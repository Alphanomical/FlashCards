Brainstorm:
-Select a set to open
-Run a test: show one side, show other side after command
    -Add # of cards to test
-Create a database for these sets
-Add a little GUI
-Add multiple choice functionality
    -Show grades
    -Add weights to represent how often I am getting the right/wrong answer
    -Randomly selected cards -> Weighted selections
    -For multiple choice, find a way to show similar choices


Further Planning:

Application opens a window
-Exit Button --> closes window (kills all activity)
